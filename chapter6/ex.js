/**
 * Write a class Vec that represents a vector 
 * in two-dimensional space. It takes x and y 
 * parameters (numbers), which it should save 
 * to properties of the same name.
 * Give the Vec prototype two methods, 
 * plus and minus, that take another vector 
 * as a parameter and return a new vector
 *  that has the sum or difference of the two 
 * vectorsâ€™ (this and the parameter) x and
 *  y values.
