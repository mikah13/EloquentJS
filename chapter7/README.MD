## Project: A Robot

Note:
- The fact that something sounds like an object does not automatically mean that it should be an object in your program. Reflexively writing classes for every concept in your application tends to leave you with a collection of interconnected objects that each have their own internal, changing state. Such programs are often hard to understand and thus easy to break.


### Persistent data

- Data structures that donâ€™t change are called immutable or persistent. They behave a lot like strings and numbers in that they are who they are and stay that way, rather than containing different things at different times.
